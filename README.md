#vetPay


It’s no secret that proper mental health care is essential for veterans returning home from active duty. On top of the reluctance and social stigma that goes with seeking out mental health care, the lack of affordability can further deter veterans from getting the care that they need. VetPay looks to alleviate those burdens.

##HOW IT WORKS 
VetPay is designed to be used by mental health professions and employees of the VA to help veterans find affordable mental health coverage. If you are a mental health professional, or MHP, that operates with a sliding scale payment system, you will create an account and list the minimum and maximum amounts that you are willing to accept for veteran patients. If you are a vet, or assisting vets with finding mental health, you will input what you are willing and able to spend. Using the Google Map API, VetPay will then be able to find MHPs in your area that you can afford to visit.

##WHY VETPAY? 
A 2016 VA study found that roughly 20 veterans a day commit suicide. A recurring problem is that a need for mental health care is identified too late in a veteran’s life and the additional burden of high costs compound into what many see as a hopeless situation. But there should be nothing hopeless about wanting our soldiers to feel mentally safe and financially secure when they return home.

##COMMUNITY IMPACT
The goal of this project to connect veterans with the affordable mental health care that they need and deserve. We want to show veterans that there are resources out there to help them and that they shouldn’t be discouraged from moving forward with their lives.
